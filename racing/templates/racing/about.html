<p>
    Canadian cross country fans are used to scouring the internet for individual and team race results in PDFs generated by various meet management programs (<a href="https://hytek.active.com/">HY-TEK</a>, <a href="https://www.goeasyware.com/">Easy Meet Manager</a>, and others).
</p>

<p>
    This site aims to make these results more accessible. That means:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Each race has individual and team results</li>
    <li>Every race is available (limited by the time it takes to upload results)</li>
    <li>Data is linked together across races (runners, teams, etc.)</li>
    <li>Results are presented consistently and intuitively in HTML (not PDFs!)</li>
</ul>
